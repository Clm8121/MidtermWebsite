          <p class="paragraph">I’m a digital media artist and I've worked in both digital and traditional art media.  My fondness for traditional art lies in mediums such as graphite, oils, and watercolors. I started to seriously pursue traditional art in early middle school to the present day.  In high school, I was a competitor in YCASE: York Community Arts Scholars Exhibition two years in a row.  There, I was hand-picked to show my artwork in a highly competitive field of fellow artists ranging in experience from high school or graduate college level.  I was a finalist for both years and won 2nd placements in 2 categories of “Still Life” and “Painting.”

          While my digital experience started in high school, I worked my way through many different mediums such as photography, illustration, film and animation, audio editing, creative coding, and web development. During my high school and college years, I have done extensive work in professional programs like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, and Premier. For my work that requires audio editing, I’m proficient in Reaper Audio Software.

          Throughout my personal work, I’m inspired by loose motions and cool colors like blues, purples, and magenta. My aesthetic can change from playful and colorful, to deep and emotional.  I continue to work on expanding my skills in all mediums, subject matters, and themes to improve my future commission work.  I strive to work as a graphic designer who specializes in polishing a company’s marketing image.
